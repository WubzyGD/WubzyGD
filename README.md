## Wanna "hire" me?

> *I kind of love coding so I'll do just about anything for free*

Contact me on Discord if you want my services! I charge nothing more than a little bit of credit in whatever it is we'll be making. Check out my orgs and respositories, and my works above, to see my portfolio of work.

I also have an email: wubzy@wubzy.xyz. You're free to contact this as well, though I will reply much faster over Discord.
