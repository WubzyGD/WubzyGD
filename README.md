## About me 

> ![WubzyGD](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/745185224069218305/820976987254423582/hatsuhapp-e.gif)

I'm Wubzy, a hobbyist JS/TS, discord.js, and Python developer, though I do a lot of stuff in a variety of languages.

You can find me on [Discord](https://discord.com) at **WubzyGD#8766**, where I spent a lot of my time.

I also have a **website**! Have a look at https://wubzy.xyz
